<P>

To start a new game goto the upper-right corner of the game window and press the button that says "New Game"<BR>

In the new game window (which should pop up) you see 2 sections. The top section lets you select the ammount of players in the new game and the bottom section lets you select the type of ships and the control over the player for the new game.<BR>

Adjust these settings as you see fit then goto the bottom of the new game window and press 'New game', depending on the speed of the game set and the speed of your computer the game should load in a second or two.
