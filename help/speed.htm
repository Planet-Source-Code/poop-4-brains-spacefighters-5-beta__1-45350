To adjust the speed of the game you must first goto the options window.<BR>

If you are not already there then goto the upper-right part of the game window and click the button that says 'Options' now the options window should pop up.<BR>

Now when you are in the options window goto the tab that says speed. There you should find the instructions to adjust the speed.<BR>
